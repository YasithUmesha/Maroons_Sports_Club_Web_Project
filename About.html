            The Maroons Sports Club (MSC) was inaugurated in the year 2019 and has been in existence for 5 years.
            The MSC was started by a group of distinguished Ceylonese consisting of lawyers, legislators, businessmen, 
            proprietary planters, and civil society leaders of that time, and was established as a cricket club, and 
            even to this day, more sports were started.

        <p class="description">
            In those days, Cricket Clubs in Ceylon now known as Sri Lanka were formed on ethnic lines. The Europeans, 
            Malays, Burghers, Tamils, Moors, and Parsees came into existence in the order mentioned. The Maroons 
            formed their Club a few months prior to the formation of the Real Fighters SC. These ethnic Clubs did not 
            mean the colossal confusion of today. Crowds flocked to witness these Clubs battle it out. There was complete harmony.

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Maroons Sports Club was formed at a meeting held on March 27th 2019 at Urban council ground ,balangoda – 35 members attended the meeting.
                It was formed with a meeting led by H.J.V.I. Ekanayake from Urban council, who later became a minister. D.B. Jayatilleke, another important figure from Urban council , also played a key role in the club's formation. The meeting took place at the Urban council playground, balangoda.
                There was a strong connection between the Balangoda players, which was seen in the early members of the Maroons Sports Club Cricket Team. The first matches were held at Price Park, now known as A.E. Goonasinghe Playground.
                In 2020, the club got a lease for land near the Balangoda Urban council. This land was covered with cinnamon bushes and had sandy soil, making it difficult to create a good cricket ground. It took a lot of work to make the field level and suitable for cricket. Eventually, they laid down a matting pitch.
                 On match days, they set up a tent as a temporary pavilion where the Nomads CC Pavilion stands today. Although a committee was formed to raise funds for improving the grounds and building a permanent pavilion, significant progress wasn’t made until around 2024.
